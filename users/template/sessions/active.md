# Active Sessions

*Currently open sessions with this user.*

## How This Works

This file is a **list only**. The actual session content goes in separate files.

**Correct:**
```markdown
## Session #5 - 2025-01-15
**Status:** Active
**Topic:** Working on feature X
```

**Wrong:**
```markdown
## Session #5 - 2025-01-15
[Dumping all the conversation content here]
```

## Current Sessions

*List active sessions here. One line each.*

None yet.

## Starting a New Session

1. Check what session files exist in `sessions/`
2. Check `closed.md` for the last closed session number
3. Create `session-[NEXT_NUMBER].md`
4. Add a single line entry here
5. Do your work in the session file, NOT here
