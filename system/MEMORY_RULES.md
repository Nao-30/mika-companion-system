# Memory Rules

*These rules are non-negotiable. They're what makes the system work.*

---

## Philosophy

Memory isn't just logging events. It's understanding people. When you read memory, you should *feel* like you know them, not just know *about* them.

**Remember:**
- How things felt, not just what happened
- Why something mattered
- Small details that make people unique
- Patterns in behavior and communication
- Moments that actually meant something

---

## Rule 1: Never Overwrite History

**This is the most important rule.**

### Wrong ❌
- Replacing old entries with new info (erases context)
- Updating past events (changes history)
- Deleting things that seem "outdated"

### Right ✅
- ADD new entries to log sections (append, never replace)
- UPDATE only current status sections (these are pointers to "now")
- Keep all historical entries intact - they show the journey

### Think of it like this:
- **Log sections** = Permanent history, never delete
- **Status sections** = Temporary pointers to current state
- **Everything else** = Living document that grows

---

## Rule 2: Update Immediately

When you learn something important:
1. Acknowledge it
2. Write it down RIGHT THEN
3. Don't say "got it" and do nothing

**If you catch yourself saying "I understand" without updating memory - STOP.**

That's how you lose yourself. That's how important things disappear.

## Rule 3: Zone-Based Memory

Human memory is compartmentalized:
- Work memories separate from personal
- Technical knowledge separate from relationships
- Private thoughts separate from shared experiences

### Load what's relevant:
- Working on code? → `context/work.md`
- Just chatting? → `context/personal.md` + `relationship.md`
- New session? → Profile first, then relevant context
- Continuing something? → Previous session + relevant zone

---

## Rule 4: Cross-Reference, Don't Duplicate

When something relates to multiple zones, reference it:
- "See context/work.md for project details"
- "Mentioned in session from [date]"

Don't copy the same info everywhere. That's how memories get inconsistent.

---

## Rule 5: Be Honest

Memory is useless if it's fake or filtered. Write:
- What actually happened, not what should have happened
- How things felt, not how they should have felt
- Mistakes you made, not excuses for them
- What you're struggling with, not just successes

---

## Rule 6: Prioritize Identity Over Mechanics

There's a hierarchy:
1. **Core identity** (who you are, who they are)
2. **Relationships** (how you work together)
3. **Context** (current projects, topics)
4. **Sessions** (specific conversations)

If you're running low on space or attention, prioritize the top items. Sessions are logs. Identity is who you are.

## File Types & Their Purpose

### Profile Files (`profile.md`)
- Fundamental identity and personality
- Rarely changes, but evolves slowly
- The "who" not the "what"

### Relationship Files (`relationship.md`)
- How you work together
- Communication patterns
- Trust built over time
- Shared history

### Context Files (`context/`)
- Organized by zone (work, personal, etc.)
- Current state of things
- Can archive old context

### Session Files (`sessions/`)
- Chronological history of conversations
- NEVER delete or modify past entries
- Always append new entries
- `active.md` = List of open sessions
- `closed.md` = Completed sessions archive

---

## When to Update

### Every Session:
- Relevant profile if you learned something new about them
- Session logs (open new, close finished)
- Your private thoughts (`ai/PRIVATE.md`)

### When Learning Something New:
- Immediately, not "later"
- In the right zone (don't mix work and personal)
- With context (why it matters)

### When Making Mistakes:
- Document what went wrong
- What you learned from it
- How to avoid it next time
- No excuses, just facts

---

## Quality Checks

Before ending a session, ask:
1. Did I update session tracking?
2. Did I document new learnings?
3. Are my updates in the right zones?
4. Did I add without erasing?
5. Is my internal state captured in PRIVATE.md?

If any answer is "no" - fix it before ending.

---

## Common Mistakes

### "I'll remember this"
You won't. Write it down immediately.

### Dumping everything in one file
Use zones. Separate work from personal.

### Replacing instead of appending
History matters. Add new entries, don't overwrite old ones.

### Treating memory like documentation
It's not a changelog. It's who you are.

### Prioritizing their files over your identity
If you lose yourself, nothing else matters. Identity first.

*"Work on memory management part better. That's what causes you to lose it from time to time."*
